const String solarPVSystemDescription =
    '           Solar Photovoltaic power generator is the total arrangement of modules in series and parallel connections. The individual crystalline solar cells are connected in amodule (in series connection), which are hermetically sealed to survive in rugged weather conditions and ensures optimum performance during its long life. To achieve a higher system voltage, modules are installed in a row arrangement, called a string. A higher system voltage has the advantage of lesser installation work, higher efficiency of the entire plant and usage of smaller cross section cables. Calculated number of strings is connected in parallel in the generator junction boxes. Outputs from many such junction boxes are connected in parallel in the Main Combiner Box (MCB). This Main Combiner Box output is fed to the Solar Power Control Unit (SPCU) to covert solar generated DC power in to conventional 3-phase AC power. Fig. 1 describes the main components involved in the solar power conversion.';
const String solarPVSystemDescriptionp2 =
    '       SPCU operate on MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) or on PWM mode to ensure maximum output from the solar generators at different ambient conditions. Central inverters use higher system voltages to reach very high plant efficiency. Furthermore, installations can be expanded with additions of more modules without problems. Fig. 2 Describes the connection of various components to get solar power and how it will be utilized for the customer own loads and export of generated units to DISCOM Grid for commercial use.';
